Hearthstone - Simple multiworld homes
====================================

Hearthstone is a plugin for the Minecraft wrapper [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) that allows players to set a single home per world and cooldowns between teleports. It also allows administrators to bypass the cooldown and teleport to any other players home. Additionally it prevents players from setting their home in regions that they are not allowed to build in.

## Features

- Each player can set one home per world
- Configurable cooldown between teleports.
- Able to teleport to any other player's home.
- Prevents players from teleporting into harmful things (like a block of stone)
- Prevents players from setting home locations in places where they are unable to build.
- Multilanguage support (even down to the command and permission nodes)

## Requirements

- [Bukkit Persistence](https://github.com/grandwazir/Hearthstone/wiki/database) needs to be configured in bukkit.yml

## Installation

### Ensure you are using the latest recommended build.

Before installing, you need to make sure you are running at least the latest [recommended build](http://dl.bukkit.org/latest-rb/craftbukkit.jar) for Bukkit. Support is only given for problems when using a recommended build. This does not mean that the plugin will not work on other versions of Bukkit, the likelihood is it will, but it is not supported.

### Getting Hearthstone

The best way to install Hearthstone is to use the [symbolic link](http://repository.james.richardson.name/symbolic/Hearthstone.jar) to the latest version. This link always points to the latest version of Hearthstone, so is safe to use in scripts or update plugins. Additionally you can to use the [RSS feed](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/Hearthstone/files.rss) provided by BukkitDev as this also includes a version changelog.
    
Alternatively [older versions](http://repository.james.richardson.name/releases/name/richardson/james/bukkit/hearthstone/) are available as well, however they are not supported. If you are forced to use an older version for whatever reason, please let me know why by [opening a issue](https://github.com/grandwazir/Hearthstone/issues/new) on GitHub.

## Configuration
