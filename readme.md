# Hearthstone 

A plugin for the Bukkit framework that allows players to set one home per world. Hearthstone is designed to be a lightweight and easy to configure home plugin. It is also 100% localisable (even down to the permission nodes). Additionally moderators can teleport to any house they like and bypass the cooldown between teleports. 

## Requirements

- Bukkit Persistence needs to be configured in bukkit.yml
- If using MySQL for Persistence, you need a MySQL database
